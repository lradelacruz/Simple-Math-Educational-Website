	<p>Many kindergarten, middle school, and high school students learn from our 
	personalized one-on-one tutoring service. Our highly trained and professional 
	tutors are ready to collaborate with students of all ages, subjects, and learning 
	styles. We can have a thorough evaluation, in which our assessment expert conducts an 
	interview with the student and administers a written screening examination. 
	One-on-one focus enables a more accurate evaluation of the student's skills and desires. 
	We take pride in matching the right mentor to the student's needs. Our services are open to students, 
	caregivers, and adults of all ages.</p>

	<p>Drop-in Homework Help sessions help students with their schoolwork, worksheets, and research guides 
	if required. We can not assist with take-home exams, only with identical examples. 
	Students can walk in for help during our dedicated Homework Help hours without an appointment, 
	but please call first to ensure that room is open. This service is convenient for students who need 
	assistance on occasion, as well as students who need a relaxed study atmosphere in which to complete
	homework with expert guidance. Because of the small group model, the instructor is able to assist each 
	student if appropriate.</p>
