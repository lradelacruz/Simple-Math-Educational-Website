	<h2>About Us. . .</h2>
	<p>Currently, we are in a new normal where we do online class that allows both the teacher and the student to set their own learning pace, 
	as well as the additional ease of creating a plan that works for everyone. 
	A shared agenda between the student and teacher will also encourage all sides to take on 
	more roles and gain more autonomy. But it seems tough for most of the students to do online class and not all students 
	have a strong internet connection. That's why the <i>Simple Math</i> is here to rescue!
	<br>
	Simple Math wanted to help students difficulties in Mathemathics and most especially Simple Math believe that any of the children would be 
	unable to resume their studies as a result of the current normal, which was difficult for them to provide. Education never ends, particularly inside the walls of children's homes. 
	It is also the notion that no child should be left behind.
